# File Differencing and Compression

## Overview
This project implements file differencing and compression using two Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) techniques. 
The goal is to:
1. Find the differences between:
   - File 1 and File 2 (small files).
   - File 3 and File 4 (big files).
2. Compress the difference file(s) generated from the comparisons.

## Features
- Efficient file differencing using advanced algorithms.
- Compression of the difference files to save storage and improve transmission efficiency.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or above). Install the required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koustubs/File-differencing-Compression.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd File-differencing-Compression
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Place your files (File 1, File 2, File 3, and File 4) in the appropriate directory.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. The output will include:
   - The difference files for both sets of comparisons.
   - Compressed versions of the difference files.
